I graduated from the University of Missouri - Columbia (colloquially known as Mizzou) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I successfully completed a software development engineering internship at Amazon in the summer of 2022 and obtained a full-time offer, just one semester before my graduation in December of 2022. However, my offer like many others was unfortunately delayed for six months until August of 2023. While I am a dedicated software engineer, I am also a dedicated father to my three-year-old daughter and a dedicated husband to my wife. Because of this, I have familial & financial obligations to fullfil and cannot afford to wait idly for half a year.
